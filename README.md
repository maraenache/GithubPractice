### ðŸ“‹ Personal Feedback â€“ Favorite Chapter

I found Chapter 6. Deploying Websites with Git and Github **extremely interesting** â€“ definitely the **most helpful** one in the course so far. The information is clear, practical, and directly applicable to real-life scenarios.

 **Action Plan:** Iâ€™m planning to use what I learned here to create a **professional CV**. This is an important step for my personal development, and this chapter gave me exactly the tools I needed.
